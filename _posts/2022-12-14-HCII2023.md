According to today's email, my paper has been accepted for publication in the Conference Proceedings 
and for presentation at the [HCII 2023 Conference](https://2023.hci.international/papers.html){:target="_blank"}.

[my blog of Nov 4, 2023] (https://oudeng.github.io/paper/2022/11/04/Extented-Abstact-for-HCII2023/){:target="_blank"} 
listed its extented abstraction submission, which is laso uploaded to arXiv([https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03936](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03936)).

I downloaded the necessary latex template from the [HCII2023 official site](https://2023.hci.international/guidelines-for-final-camera-ready-papers){:target="_blank"} today.
It is a simple template that passed the typeset in my local Mac TexShop.

Important. Appreciate the kind comments from the reviewer as follows.

>Comments:  
>The paper provides an interesting approach to simulation experiments with multi-agent systems and artificial intelligence methods.
>Please provide more insights into past literature and the theory you base your modeling on. It is hard to judge the novelty of the approach based on the provided information.

>Additional comments:  
>1. Avoid writing the I, We, you, etc. in the research articles.
>2. The paper is well written but needs to restructure the abstract section. Include, intro, objectives, methodology, findings, and concluding remarks in a very brief.

Due to the full paper submission deadline of **Feb 10, 2023**, I will have a busy new year holiday.
