### ABSTRACT

To characterize complex higher-order interactions among variables in a system, we introduce a new framework for decomposing the information 
entropy of variables in a system, termed System Information Decomposition (SID). Diverging from Partial Information Decomposition (PID) correlation methods,
which quantify the interaction between a single target variable and a collection of source variables, SID extends those approaches by equally examining
the interactions among all system variables. Specifically, we establish the robustness of the SID framework by proving all the information atoms are symmetric,
which detaches the unique, redundant, and synergistic information from the specific target variable, empowering them to describe the interactions between variables.
Additionally, we analyze the relationship between SID and existing information measures and pro- pose several properties that SID quantitative methods should follow.
Furthermore, by employing an illustrative example, we demonstrate that SID uncovers higher-order interaction relationships among variables that cannot be captured
by current measures of probability and information and provide two approximate calculation methods verified by this case. This advance in higher-order measures
enables SID to explain why Holism posits that some systems cannot be decomposed without losing characteristics under existing measures and offers a potential
quantification framework for higher-order relationships across a broad spectrum of disciplines.
