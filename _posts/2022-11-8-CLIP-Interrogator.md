[CLIP Interrogator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pharma/CLIP-Interrogator) is an interesting stable diffusion demo of Text-to-image prompt inversion, i.e., output the image description text by inputting an image.

In its offcial site, you will see its proud announcement: *Want to figure out what a good prompt might be to create new images like an existing one? The [CLIP Interrogator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pharma/CLIP-Interrogator) is here to get you answers!*

The trail on this site.

- The input is my face picture.
- After a few minutes, I got the prompt output as follows:
 
> a close up of a person wearing glasses, a character portrait, inspired by Yoshihiko Wada, pixiv contest winner, precisionism, selfie shot straight on angle, ai researcher, high forehead, loosely cropped, piano in the background, interconnections, 3 6 years old, stanley lau, black turtleneck

Really interesting. 
However, who is Yoshihiko Wada? I searched in web and found the answer.

P.S.:
It might be similar to the [GAN Inversion](https://github.com/weihaox/awesome-gan-inversion).
