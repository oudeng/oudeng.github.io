[CLIP Interrogator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pharma/CLIP-Interrogator){:target="_blank"} is an interesting stable diffusion demo of Text-to-image prompt inversion, i.e., output the image description text by inputting an image. It might be similar to the [GAN Inversion](https://github.com/weihaox/awesome-gan-inversion){:target="_blank"}.
