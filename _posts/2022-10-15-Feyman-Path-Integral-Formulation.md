Cause-Effect can be described as DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph, by Judea Pearl). DAG always requires observable data and an inferential path. The former is the big data in our hands. The latter is our problem. Our current solutions are (1) Known path by domain knowledge, (2) Hypothesis, then statistical analysis. However, while these two solutions are out of the question, how do we do?

Dr.Feyman faced the similar problem in quantum mechanics research and developed Feynman's path integral formulation.

Are the causal paths the same or similar? Before clarifying the causal path(s), we assume the infinite paths between the cause and effect. Feynman's path integral formulation might help us explore the causation mechanism.

Due to understand Feynman's path integral formulation, we'd better warm up the [Morden Quantum Mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLstdOGDXMaWJ3HnIclSo_tt44ly2ulfOq){:target="_blank"}.
