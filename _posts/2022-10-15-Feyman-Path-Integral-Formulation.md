Cause-Effect can be described as DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph, by Judea Pearl).
DAG always requires the observable data and inferential path. The former is the big data in our hand. The latter is our problem.
Our current solutions are mainly: (1) Known path by domain knowledges; (2) Hypothesis, then statistical analyzing. 
However, while these two solutions are out of the questions, how do we do? 

Dr.Feyman faced the similar problem in quantum mechannics reaserch and developed Feynman's path integral formulation.

Are the causal paths the same or similar? Before the causal path(s) being clarified, we assumpt the infinite paths between the cause and effect. Feynman's path integral formulation might help us explore the causation mechanism.

Due to understand Feynman's path integral formulation, we'd better warm up the [Morden Quantum Mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLstdOGDXMaWJ3HnIclSo_tt44ly2ulfOq).
